Definitely NOT a top secret blogging platform project.

Ok this is the early stages of of a blogging app. It uses the following technologies:

- C# ASP.NET Web Forms (.Net Framework 4.7.2)
- ADO.NET
- jQuery Ajax
- Web API 2
- SQL Server LocalDb
- Bootstrap 4
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
- TSQL (Stored Procs)
- Bootstrap Modals
- Blog Home & Blog Post Templates from GetBootstrap
- Slate Theme from Bootswatch

It is an attempt to show several different concepts, including but not limited to:

- Readable, understandable, maintainable, industry standard code
- Meaningful naming conventions (typically a modern version of camel-case Hungarian notation)
- Inheritance (more specifically, ASP.NET Pages/Master Pages inheriting from custom base classes)
- Custom ADO.NET Data Access class (because real devs write their own data access layer)
- Model classes to represent 'business' objects
- Separation of concerns / separation of responsibilities
- Modularity

..and yes, you will also see things like:

- Dynamic HTML with SQL data generated from Code Behind / Base Classes
- Execution of JavaScript functions from Code Behind /  Base Classes
